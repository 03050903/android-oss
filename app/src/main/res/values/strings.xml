  <!-- Deprecated strings, these should to be replaced in favor of strings that have been translated.
    Prefix keys name with ___, that way when working with strings elsewhere it is immediately obvious when a string
    is deprecated based on its name.

    There may be a few strings here that we *don't* want to translate, we'll figure out a nice space for them later. -->
